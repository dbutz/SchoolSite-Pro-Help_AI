The Main feature dataset contains the feature classes that are typically updated on an ongoing basis by the school district including streets, study areas (and the inherent school attendance zones through attribute codes), school locations and development tracts. A topology set of rules are setup for streets (ie. streets must not have dangles) and a separate set of topology rules are setup for study areas (ie. study area polygons must not have gaps or must not have overlaps). If desired from an editing \"comfort\" standpoint, the streets (and streets topology) can be copied from one geodatabase to another for editing purposes and then copied back after accuracy validation. An Address Locator for student geocoding purposes against the reference data such as streets is maintained in the Basemap geodatabase.

For example, a future school site placed in or near a development occurring in the next few years may not be the best location for that school in relation to other potential school sites, as future development projects expand into other areas of the district."

Student Yield Factors for maturation are generally different than those used in the ten year new housing forecasts. The student yield factors used in the ten year forecasts are generally based on a sampling of housing units less than five years of age to better represent the number of students that would be generated as new homes are completed. Whereas, maturation, representing a future point in time with all ages of housing units, uses student yield factors that are based upon a large sample of units within the district both old and new. Generally, maturation student yield factors will have lower K-6 numbers and higher 9-12 numbers than a ten year forecast student yield due to the fact that as homes age students will be distributed more evenly among the grade levels. For this reason, ten year forecast student yield factors are not generally used for maturation since they would potentially over-estimate elementary students and under-estimate high school students for long range planning."

In most cases, you can obtain the number of births, collated by zip codes, from your State?s Department of Health and Statistics. In this example, the district contains three zip codes - 92625, 92626, and 92627. After the number of births, by year, by zip code are obtained and totaled, the percentage of change from the base year (2005) is calculated by dividing future years (2006-2009) by the base year (2005). Because data for 2009 and beyond would not yet be available, birth factors would be estimated based on past trends. Here, we estimated a continued decline in births at 93% of the base year." }

        "Build 1.9.6 FY26 Q4 Update 9 (Sep26) | SchoolSite Pro for ArcGIS Pro 3.3+",
        " Build 1.9.6 FY26 Q4 Update 9 (Sep26) New Features: New: Utilization Report. This is now an automated report and used to setup boundary comparison web apps during a rezoning project Export SYF reports during Data Setup Added CAPACITY field to the automated attendance matrix Excel file Additional residential forecasting charts available with an optional checkbox during the Report Setup Additional student types that can be added to the automated attendance matrix are only available if they exist in the student data that has been imported into SchoolSite (just like how Create Plan works) This change also resulted in much improved performance time when creating Address Directory. It is now roughly twice as fast. Project Summary Report updated based on feedback from Cameron and the standardization team (example report attached for reference on changes) Reassigning study areas by (closest school, capacity, max limit ) now allows you to choose one or more schools to exclude from this process so you can reassign most schools but keep some locked as they are Minor bugs and UI improvements: SYF calculations are only is available when importing Assessor data with polygon geometry Added a warning when calculating a forecast if Projected Housing Units are detected with no corresponding SYF values Fixed an issue with the travel modes from Esri that make creating walk zones broken Tapestry Segmentation report was deprecated, new version has been added While assigning study areas in a plan based on a forecast, you can no longer change the forecast year in the stats window. Doing so would require edits to tables and when those edits were saved it would lock in study area assignments and remove the ability to use the Undo button Build 1.9.5 FY26 Q4 Update 8 (Jul26) New Features: User can choose a school to remove, and it will automatically assign those study areas to â€˜Unassignedâ€™ Exporting a forecast report includes the tabular data and chart in the same file Improve performance of calculating a forecast Improve performance when calculating year 12 of the projected housing units table Additional misc. minor bug fixes and UI improvements Build 1.9.4 FY26 Q3 Update 7 (Jun26) Introducing new reporting features for residential forecasts New Features: SYF Automation Use parcel data to automatically generate student yield factors to apply to new housing units to estimate how many students will be generated from those new housing developments in the future The statistics window UI updates such as: Sorting the table by any column Scale/zoom in to see larger font size for improved readability Additional data validation to check consistency between student types across historical student data Lock a plan to prevent further study area re-assignments (Similar to locking in a forecast once delivered to the client) School layer in a planâ€™s map now has Map Tips turned on by default The study area numbering tool has been recreated from ArcMap Forecast can now be summarized on any available field in the study area data instead of just by attendance zone, district-wide, or sub-District (which uses the DISTRICT field) This means you can select a CITY, ZIP, or any other field present in the Study Area data to use to group study areas in a report Plans with Enrollment now use ALL student types The Estimated Enrollment tab has always shown all students who are enrolled in a school who meet the grade criteria with no regard for the value in the STUTYPE field (GE, SE, CH, etc..) When making a â€˜Plan with Enrollmentâ€™, it does not ask you which student types you want to use like it does with a residence-based plan. Therefore, it was unclear that the students in the Current tab were only â€˜GEâ€™ students. This is now DIFFERENT : Moving forward, the â€˜Currentâ€™ tab will work similarly to the â€˜Estimated Enrollmentâ€™ tab in that it will show ALL students who RESIDE in the schoolâ€™s boundary and meet the grade criteria specified with no regard for the value in the STUTYPE field. This will make the methodology in â€˜Plans with Enrollmentâ€™ consistent and show ALL resident students in one tab and ALL enrolled students in the other tab Additional misc. minor bug fixes and UI improvements Build 1.9.3 FY26 Q2 Update 6 (Jan26) Introducing new reporting features for residential forecasts New Features: Show the codes chosen for unit types 1-6 on the projected units, SYF and MSYF pages In Forecast Report dock pane, add ability to summarize selected study area features Allow Demographic Reports to be created for All Polygons in a feature class. Minor bugs and UI improvements Fixed bug in plans based on forecast where the stats windowâ€™s data for year 0 (current year) did not include other STUTYPES that were included in the forecast (SSP-230) Fixed issue in forecast reports that did not accept a grade range of -1-6 or -1-12 because it could not correctly parse the two dash characters (SSP-231) Build 1.9.2 FY26 Q2 Update 5 (Jan26) Introducing a new Walk Zone tool New Features Generate walk zone polygons around school points at any distance or time (e.g. 1, 3, 5 mile distances or 5, 10, 15 minutes) for use in analysis for your district. Bugs fixed: Fixed bug in street/address directories when schools have STRT_GRD of -2 (SSP-212) Added ability to prompt user to open the Address Directory from Pro after exporting, rather than make them browse to the folder first. Fixed bug SSP-215 that did not update the stats window of plan based on a forecast after viewing other student attribute and then selecting grade distribution and a forecast year in the future (numbers did not reflect the future forecasted yearâ€™s data) Build 1.9.1 FY26 Q1 Update 4 (Dec25) Bugs fixed: Fixed issue with Rate of Change enrollment forecast that caused no results to be created for grades 10, 11, and 12 Fixed issue that prevented the â€˜Currently selected study areas on mapâ€™ option from being enabled in a factor dockpane when features were selected Fixed issue with closing a forecast factor that would leave the table open Updated the phrasing of a data validation message to make it more clear (regarding students enrolled outside the grades that the District serves) Build 1.9.0 FY26 Q1 Update 3 (Dec25) Introducing â€˜Sync Plansâ€™ feature and moreâ€¦ New Features New option to sync changes between multiple plans: This does not work with Plans based on enrollment; only residence and forecasted students. Checking on plans in the â€˜Plans to Syncâ€™ menu will push the following changes to those plans: Boundary reassignments; Reassignment of study areas from their current school to a different school. Any changes using the Reassign Study Area button (allows you to reassign all study areas by closest school, capacity, max limit, etcâ€¦) Add new/existing school or update capacity You can now summarize the statistics window by â€˜Student Attributeâ€™ in a plan based on forecasted data You can now use keyboard modifiers when selecting study areas during reassignment, just like the out-of-the-box selection tools in Pro Holding SHIFT when selecting will ADD more study areas to the current selection Holding CTRL when selecting will REMOVE study areas from the current selection Minor bugs and UI improvements Fixed a bug that would clear out any feature selections unexpectedly, making it difficult to see selected records Updated Statistics Window title to include the planâ€™s name, so the user can easily tell which plan those statistics relate to when multiple maps are open, sometimes plans can be open side by side when syncing and now the stats dock pane shows the planâ€™s name to reduce confusion. IMPORTANT! The new enrollment forecast methodology (Rate of Change) has been updated slightly The change in this version is that the K class calculation is now done the same as the PK class using the â€˜Direct Rate of Changeâ€™ formula. See our full documentation for more details. Build 1.8.9 FY26 Q1 Update 2 (Nov25) Introducing â€˜Rate of Changeâ€™ enrollment forecast & study area ID tool for forecasts New method for creating enrollment forecasts: Rate of Change This adds a new methodology called â€˜Rate of Changeâ€™ in addition to the existing â€˜Transfer Patternâ€™ method User can select from a menu which method to use Rate of Change method only applies to schools with a boundary. Schools with no boundary (magnet, district wide, etc.) will still use the â€˜Transfer Patternâ€™ method Study area ID tool for forecasts: Click on a study area and see a popup windows with all the factors applied to that polygon and the forecast results generated in a single click Plan overlay feature now allows you to add more than one overlay and only removes them when you choose the first option in the list â€œDo not overlay another planâ€, otherwise the user must remove them individually. New tooltips and explanation labels for Data Enrichment and Enrollment Forecast tools New tooltips, help information, and UI updates Fixed bugs and made improvements to copying and renaming plans and forecasts Data Enrichment: updated tooltips, screenshots, and UI labels to help explain what will be included in the output based on user input selections Various improvements to UI elements across the application for better consistency New Help button on SchoolSite â€˜Shareâ€™ ribbon to direct users to our web help documents Build 1.8.8 FY26 Q1 Update 1 (Oct25) Introducing Automated Attendance Matrix feature Fixed error when entering a lowercase grade range like â€˜k-6â€™ Added an option to include â€˜SEâ€™ students when making an automated attendance matrix Changed the data type requirements to enforce only â€˜shortâ€™ int numerical values instead of â€˜shortâ€™ or â€˜longâ€™ integers to avoid any really large numbers in the input that might be attempted to get written to another table that only accepts â€˜shortâ€™ Changed a data validation from error to warning If a school serves a grade, and no students are enrolled in that grade, it now reports a warning instead of error Added a warning to identify overlaps in school coverage such as a study area assigned a K-6 elementary and a 6-8 middle that could indicate an option area for grade 6 that might go otherwise unnoticed. Build 1.8.7 FY26 Q1 release Introducing Automated Attendance Matrix feature Create an attendance matrix using GE â€œGeneral Educationâ€ students by defining the grade ranges for each of the grade levels present in the study area data. Data enrichment tool upgrade This tool will now enrich both current study areas as well as now plans so you can attach forecasted student counts to proposed attendance boundaries from plans you create. Misc changes Imported historical student data is now enriched (just like current year student data already was) with three additional fields of data: school name of residence, school code of residence, and school name of enrollment New data validation rule that will check to determine grades served district wide (that make up the attendance boundaries) and make sure all students are in grades served by those schools Minor UI updates, tooltips, etc. Build 1.8.6 Introducing Program Re-assignment feature Import programs (special ed, music, dual language, etc. Each program has a number of reserved classroom seats) Add new programs/delete programs Reassign programs from one school to another Stats window now shows a modified capacity column that reduces the overall capacity based on the number of seats of programs assigned to that school New data validation rules Detect if a study area is assigned to schools that create gaps in grade range coverage Detect if a student is enrolled in a school that does not serve their grade (8th grader enrolled in a 9-12 school) Detect if a school serves a grade that has no students enrolled (school serves K-6 but only has K-5 enrolled) Misc changes Several improvments and bugs addressed for plans with enrollment Minor UI updates, tooltips, etc. Build 1.8.5 Pre-Fall revisions Bug fixes to plans with enrollment Student enrichment to imported data and original source to add fields defining school of enrollment and school of residence More help information New background on load New â€˜Copyâ€™ button for plans/forecasts Changes to capacity can be saved back to imported schools for future plans Updates to rendering a forecast to alter alias of DISPLAY for Map Contents window Bypass warning message option enabled New schools in a plan automatically becomes target school for assignment Build 1.8.4 Pre-Fall upgrades (March 2025) Updates and bug fixes to plans with enrollment Read-only mode for forecasts to lock in factors Forecast appearance labeled to describe current settings New and updated help and tooltip icons and information Address directory upgrades for more compatibility across different Student Information Systems Reset Project tool now offers just to reset address directory information instead of all data Build 1.8.3 Plans with enrollment (April 2025 - internal only release for testing) First release that will create plans showing both residence and enrollment counts Minor UI updates and improvements Fixed issue when closing SchoolSite Pro from start page which caused it the hang requiring a force close New buttons to show plan/forecast comments to review how they were setup/configured Update help icons for better, more consistent look across tools Additional changes: Excel reports prompt the user to open them after export, which auto launches Excel and opens the report Build 1.8.2 Address Directory updates (March 2025) Updated address directory output to include: MID_, prefix direction, prefix type, suffix direction Build 1.8.1 Street/Address Directory release (February 2025) Updated error checking to prevent issues in various tools by limiting special characters used in plan and forecast names Updated tooltips and help links with more to come across the application Updates, UI tweaks, and bug fixes to Street/Address Directories based on feedback from the beta released at 1.8.0 Build 1.8.0 - Internal only release (February 2025) Beta release of street/address directory tools for internal testing MGT branding updates New help button and contextual help icons to help users navigate to https://ssphelp.mgt.us/ Various UI updates, alignments, layout improvements especially on the Start Page Enrollment forecast Excel formatting updates for better consistency Build 1.7.9 - August release (August 2024) Fixed bug introduced with ArcGIS Pro 3.3 when using Plan Impact Summary report Build 1.7.8 - August release (August 2024) Fixed bug when copying a forecast Updated format for enrollment forecasts and Excel export to be more consistent with residence forecasts and align with template guidelines Build 1.7.7 - ArcGIS Pro 3.3+ only (July 2024) Fixed additional bugs related to limited field names in ArcGIS Pro 3.3 causing exporting reports/tables to Excel to fail such as the statistics window and causing importing of historical student to fail when calulating mobility Added ability to import street data in preparation for street directory tool Build 1.7.6 - ArcGIS Pro 3.3+ only (July 2024) Minor UI updates Data Enrichment Tools released to enrich tract data with estimated number of students based on units and SYF. Also creates enriched study area data with numbers of forecasted students in each area. Reset Project bug fixed that lead to missing TYPE2 units being imported Added Capacity for each school in forecast report when reporting on attendance areas and formatted for output in Excel Build 1.7.5 (Nov 2023) Fixed problem when importing historical students Build 1.7.4 (Nov 2023) This build fixes an issue preventing the assignment of study areas to the target school in plans that have been copied and/or renamed. Build 1.7.3 (Nov 2023) Bugs fixed for labeling in plans Bugs fixed for symbolizing a forecast Bugs fixed for showing the data about the selected study areas in a plan when boundary planning Bugs fixed for changing which grade ranges are shown in the statistics table Bugs fixed for error messages that are shown when a forecast was first created Build 1.7.2 (Oct 2023) Student yield factors have been expanded from just PK, K-6, 7-8, 9-12 to PK through 12 with all individual grades. New sorting of enrollment forecasts allows straight alphabetical sorting instead of grouping elementary first followed by middle and high and then listed alphabetically in those groups. Fixed bugs when using Remove Unassigned Schools and Plan Summary Build 1.7.1 (Aug 2023) New feature: Reset Geodatabase allows the user to delete all imported data and maps that have plans or forecasts to start over with new data in the same project Plan statistics and forecast reports no longer have pre-defined grade ranges of K-6,7-8,9-12. It only has a grade range textbox for easier entry Layers that have definition expressions are flagged during Data Setup as warnings to alert the user Changed all references of Maturation to Buildout In Forecasts, under Appearance, you are now able to symbolize resident student change to have its end year as Buildout. Bug fixes related to data setup for historical students Bug fixes for when enrollment forecast would indicate changes were made to resident forecast when they had not been forcing an unneeded recalculation of the enrollment forecast Bug fixes when exporting mobility reports. Build 1.7.0 (Feb 2023) Updated start page for improved ability to find previous Projects Fixed bugs found when working with specific datasets related to features such as: Exporting plans Warning when the license is about to expire Enrollment forecasts Reassign by current boundaries Improved rounding to avoid really long decimal values Plan Summary report Forecast report setup was missing grade ranges on occasion Build 1.6.9 (Dec 2022) Fixed bugs when making a forecast Build 1.6.8 (Dec 2022) Fixed bugs preventing the successful export of forecast reports to both text and Excel formats Improved the rounding of values in the plan stats window so they would not exceed two decimal points Updated the messaging around enrollment forecasts to make sure the report indicates that it needs to be refreshed after changes are made to residential forecast values. This message would previously disappear too soon. Enrollment forecasts now show a warning when it detects that a school has had a significant gap in enrollment from year to year to indicate that the resulting forecasted values could be negatively impacted. When sorting the forecast enrollment report by grade to show elementary first, then middle, followed by highâ€¦.it now considers PK and K to be the same value for sorting purposes so you donâ€™t get PK-6 followed by K-6. Those are both considered â€˜elementaryâ€™ and are in the same grouping in the report. Better handling of â€˜customâ€™ grade ranges in plan statistics and forecast report setup. Custom ranges no longer accepts grade ranges that are already available via checkbox (i.e. K-6 is not â€˜customâ€™, just select it from the set of pre-defined grade ranges. Use â€˜customâ€™ for things like K-4 or 6-8. Build 1.6.7 (Dec 2022) Schools are ordered in the report first by grade, then by name so the elementary schools are grouped alphabetically followed by middle schools, etcâ€¦ Messages when schools are excluded from reports are re-worded to make more sense as to why they could not be forecasted Added total enrollment summary line to the top of the report Build 1.6.6 (Nov 2022) Various enhancements to formatting of reports both on screen and when exported to Excel Bug fix for staffing forecast when calculating the students transferring out of the PK grade in boundary schools Fixed bug in the Project Summary report that caused it to not find the required DEVELOPER field Fixed issue where maturation units were not included in a development summary excel report in cases where a studyarea had zero development in years one thru ten but then had development beyond that. Updated Student Report to summarize an accounting of student data to give insight into what students were in the file, which were in district, and which were used in the plan or forecast broken down by STUTYPE and GRD Build 1.6.5 (Oct 2022) Built for ArcGIS Pro 3.0 First release out of beta"
